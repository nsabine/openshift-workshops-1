## Environment Overview

image::/images/environment-diagram.png[Environment Diagram,800,align="center"]


Today's workshop infrastructure is being run on {{ENVIRONMENT}}. Each student will be assigned a single instance to use.  Your student number will be substituted where you see this `${STUDENT#}`. Example: if you are student 21:
`http://workshop.21.rhtps.io`

If you do not know your user number, please make sure you figure that out with your instructor.

== Workshop Infrastructure

Each student's personal EC2 lab is equipped with the following:

*  t2.large EC2 Instance (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM)
** _All nodes are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4_
*  Web-based console access:
** https://workshop.`${STUDENT#}`.rhtps.io:8888/wetty/ssh/ec2-user
*  A directory containing all files used in this workshop.

== Setup Your Environment

Before we can begin deploying containerized applications, we've got to get a few basics out of the way. Namely... ssh access to your instance.

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to your instance.  If you can't log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!

== End Result

At this point, everyone should have logged into your node.  If you haven't, let us know so we can get you fixed up.
