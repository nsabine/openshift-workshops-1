*Launch your first application.*

.see which user you are authenticated as
[source]
----
oc whoami
----

You should be logged in as `developer`

Create a new
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html[Project]
for your first app.

.create new project
[source]
----
oc new-project flask --description="Python Flask App" --display-name="Flask App"
----

Now use the `new-app` command to create the new app from a simple Python flask
repository on GitHub. By using the `--strategy=source` we can pass it the type
of container to build and launch the app. In this case we are using
`python:3.3`.

.create the app
[source]
----
oc new-app --strategy=source python:3.3~https://github.com/RedHatGov/DC17-Flask --name=dc17-flask
----

Now follow the logs as its being built.

.follow the logs
[source]
----
oc logs -f bc/dc17-flask
----

*Open a browser next to the terminal so you can see the app get created*

=== Step 3:

*Login to OpenShift*

.Login as developer
[source]
----
Username:  developer

Password:  developer
----

.OpenShift Main Login

Click on the new project you created `Flask App`.

.Flask App

Now we need to create a
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[`route`]
to see the app.

Click `Create Route`. Accept the defaults and click `create`.

.create route

Now lets see your first app. Click the new route. It should look similar to
this `http://dc17-flask-flask.apps.ose.0.rhtps.io`.

Congratulations! You have launched your first app in OpenShift!
