## Lab: Automating Deployment with CI/CD Pipeline

### Background: CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment refer to a set of practices with
the intention of automating various aspects of delivery software. One of these
practices is Pipeline, which is an automated process to define the steps a change
in code or configuration has to go through in order to reach upper environments
such as staging and production. OpenShift supports CI/CD Pipelines by integrating
the popular https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/[Jenkins pipelines] into
the platform and enables defining truly complex workflows directly within OpenShift.

In this exercise, we are going to deploy a sample Jenkins pipeline, taking advantage
of the OpenShift-Jenkins integration.

### Exercise: Deploy Simple Pipeline 

Now let's create another project and deploy our app:

.Create a New Project
[source]
----
oc new-project simple-pipeline
----

.Deploy the Example using a pre-defined template
[source]
----
oc new-app jenkins-pipeline-example
----

In your web console, navigate to your new project.  You should see a few pod in process of deploying:


image::/images/jenkins-pipeline-deploying.png[Jenkins Pipeline Deploying]


Once Jenkins is deployed and running, click on the "Start Pipeline" button, or issue the following CLI command:

.Start the Pipeline
[source]
----
oc start-build sample-pipeline
----

A pipeline will begin running, building and deploying the application:


image::/images/jenkins-pipeline-running.png[Jenkins Pipeline Running]


That's a big of magic.  Let's dig in and see how's it working.  Click on the Builds menu, then Pipelines:


image::/images/jenkins-pipeline-status.png[Jenkins Pipeline Status]

Here you can see recent pipeline runs.  Let's edit the pipeline so we can see how this thing works.  Click "Edit Pipeline."  


image::/images/jenkins-pipeline-edit.png[Jenkins Pipeline Edit]

Here you can see the Jenkinsfile that is controlling the stages of the build.  This is a simple two-stage process:  Build, deploy.  As you can see, Jenkins is aware of the OpenShift primatives, and can invoke builds and deploys without complex syntax.
