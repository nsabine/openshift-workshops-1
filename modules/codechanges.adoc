## Making Code Changes and Using Webhooks

### Background: Web Hooks
Most Git repository servers support the concept of web hooks -- calling to an
external source via HTTP(S) when a change in the code repository happens.
OpenShift provides an API endpoint that supports receiving hooks from
remote systems in order to trigger builds. By pointing the code repository's
hook at the OpenShift API, automated code/build/deploy pipelines can be
achieved.

#### Exercise: Fork an Example App

In this lab, we're going to make a change to an app.  To do that, we need to 
fork an exising codebase so we have write permissions to the git repo.

In your web browser, sign in to GitHub and naviate to the 
https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex[NodeJS Example].

click on Fork:

image:://images/github-fork.png[Fork,800,align="center"]


#### Exercise: Deploy Your App

Now let's create a new project and deploy our app:

.Create a New Project
[source]
----
oc new-project webhooks
----

.Deploy the App
[source]
----
oc new-app https://github.com/<YOUR USENAME>/nodejs-ex 
----


#### Exercise: Configuring GitHub Web Hooks


In the OpenShift web console, navigate to your `webhook` *Project*, and
then click *Builds* and then *Builds* again. Click the `nodejs-ex` build.
Finally, click on the 'Configuration' tab.

On this screen you will see the option to copy the *github* webhook URL as shown
in the following image:

image::/images/ocp-webhook1.png[Webhook]


Once you have the URL copied to your clipboard, navigate to the code repository
that you have for your nodejs-ex project that you forked.


Click the Settings link on the top right of the screen, and then click "Webhooks", and finally click on add webhook.


In the next screen, paste your link into the "URL" field. You can leave the
secret token field blank -- the secret is already in the URL and does not need
to be in the payload.

**Note:  Also ensure that you select application/json as the Content Type**

Scroll to the bottom of the page. Make sure you *un-check* the SSL verification
box. Remember that OpenShift's API is not presenting an SSL certificate signed
by a known/trusted authority. Without *un-checking* the verification box, the
webhook will fail.

Your screen should look like this:

image::/images/ocp-webhook1-github.png[Webhook]

Finally, click on "Add webhook".


Boom! From now on, every time you commit new source code to your GitHub
repository, a new build and deploy will occur inside of OpenShift.  Let's try
this out.

#### Exercise: Using GitHub Web Hooks

Click "Code" at the top of the GitHub page. This is GitHub's repository view. Navigate to the views directory and click on the `index.html` file.

Once you have the file on the screen, click the edit button in the top right
hand corner as indication with the pencil icon:

image::/images/githubedit1.png[Webhook]

Line number 219 is the page header.  I have changed mine to the following:

[source]
----
           <h1>Welcome to the OpenShift Workshop!!</h1>
----

Click on Commit changes at the bottom of the screen. Feel free to enter a commit message.

Once you have committed your changes, a *Build* should almost instantaneously be
triggered in OpenShift. Look at the *Builds* page in the web console, or run the
following command to verify:

[source]
----
$ oc get builds
----

You should see that a new build is running:

[source]
----
NAME              TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED          DURATION
nodejs-ex-1       Source    Git@37c9176   Complete   14 minutes ago   1m6s
nodejs-ex-2       Source    Git@81ec980   Running    5 seconds ago   
----

Once the build and deploy has finished, verify your new Docker image was
automatically deployed by viewing the application in your browser.

[source]
----
http://nodejs-ex-webhooks.apps.ose.0.rhtps.io
----

[IMPORTANT]
Do you create the route?


You should now your new header.


#### Exercise: Rollback

OpenShift allows you to move between different versions of an application
without the need to rebuild each time. Every version (past builds) of the
application exists as a Docker-formatted image in the OpenShift registry. Using
the `oc rollback` and `oc deploy` commands you can move back- or forward between
various versions of applications.

In order to perform a rollback, you need to know the name of the *Deployment Config*
which has deployed the application:

[source]
----
$ oc get dc
----

The output will be similar to the following:

[source]
----
NAME        REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
nodejs-ex   2          1         1         config,image(nodejs-ex:latest)
----

Now run the following command to rollback the latest code change:

[source]
----
oc rollback nodejs-ex

#3 rolled back to nodejs-ex-1
Warning: the following images triggers were disabled: nodejs-ex:latest
  You can re-enable them with: oc set triggers dc/nodejs-ex --auto
----

Once the deploy is complete, verify that the page header is reverted to the
original header by viewing the application in your browser.

[source]
----
http://nodejs-ex-webhooks.apps.ose.0.rhtps.io
----

[NOTE]
====
Automatic deployment of new images is disabled as part of the rollback
to prevent unwanted deployments soon after the rollback is complete. To re-enable
the automatic deployments run this:

[source]
----
oc deploy nodejs-ex --enable-triggers
----
====

#### Exercise: Rollforward

Just like you performed a rollback, you can also perform a roll-forward using
the same command. You'll notice above that when you requested a roll*back*, it
caused a new deployment (#3). In essence, we always move forwards in OpenShift,
even if we are going "back".

* We know that the first deployment (#1) was the initial build.
* We know that the second deployment (#2) was the new code 
* We know that the third deployment (#3) was our rollback to the first
  "version".

So, if we want to return to the "new code" version, that is deployment #2.

[source]
----
oc rollback nodejs-ex-2

#4 rolled back to nodejs-ex-2
Warning: the following images triggers were disabled: nationalparks:latest
  You can re-enable them with: oc set triggers dc/nationalparks --auto
----

Cool!
